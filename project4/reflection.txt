After all the tests HTML and CSS were clean. But Java script had 17 warnings from jshint. Chat gpt the solution it gave me was "Set esversion: 6 in JSHint Configuration: To resolve the ES6-related warnings, I added /*jshint esversion: 6 */ at the top of the JavaScript file to enable ES6 support.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
/*jshint esversion: 6 */
This change allows JSHint to recognize and allow ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, and const/let keywords.

Afetr that only error remained was The "'esversion' option cannot be set after any executable code" for which I could not find solution.
/* jshint esversion: 6 */ was placed on top still the error occured.
